# Quick FAQ

Q: What is this?
A: This is a programming language/transpiler I'm building as a learning exercise and hobby.

Q: What is the purpose?
A: A general purpose systems language as compact and minimal as possble. Yet capable of anything (not a turing tarpit, but not bloated either)

Q: Why?
A: I wanted to learn more about compiler design and language implementation. To teach myself programming 

Q: What does pin do?
A: It is a keyword that makes a variable immutable, it is like const in C but it only enforces immutability in the current scope. When the scope ends immutability dies. The idea was to make it easier to share data between threads if it is read only, to avoid things like race conditions and mutexes/locks. 

Q: Syntax highlight?
A: I'll release the text mate vscode/windsurf extension soon.

Q: Is it memory safe?
A: It does not enforce safety but I added `defer` to help with memory management.

Q: Are you a CS major?
A: No, I am an industrial engineering undergrad, I like CS as a hobby but I want to have a coding job one day.

Q: Is this production ready?
A: Use at your own risk.

Q: Why C backend?
A: It is the mainstram language I know better. Also because I don't know enough of LLVM to write the LLVM codegen, and I think LLVM is overkill and would make the project bloated (although the tradeoff is portability). I could leverage the AI to do it, but I want to know exactly what am I doing, i don't like blackboxes. (Yet I use an AI blackbox, Oh the hypocrisy)

In essence:
I wanted to keep the project tiny with a C transpiler. Nim does it anyway.

Q: Why no shadowing?
A: We follow a "no implicit" philosophy (although we could arrive at some exceptions), i felt like shadowing was a way of making data have multiple meanings in different parts of the code.

Q: Do you know how to code in any language?
A: I have most experience with C and some C++, and i've tinkered with Rust and Python but I am most comfortable around C

Q: Will you implement concurrency?
A: My idea for concurrency is this (similar in spirit to Pony):
    - Data is owned by only one thread at a time, no shared mutable states. It sounds extreme, but this is the simplest way i can understand to avoid race conditions. Therefore data is lent from one thread to another via some explicit operator, the data given (not borrowed) is dead on the main scope and cannot be reused. I havent implemented this on tC, and I am not sure if I ever will.

Q: Do you use AI?
A: I'll be honest, yes, a lot. But as a speed boost. There is no honor unlike handcoding everything. I am not a very seasoned dev yet. I know it has less merit. But my philosophy is to use modern tools for modern problems.

Q: Was this FAQ Ai generated?
A: No, I hand wrote it

Q: Why the name Tight C?
A: It is a double meaning pun, it abbreviates as tC which is a reference to holy C (the programming language) by Terry Davis (Ct) the t is a cross/crucifix. And it is called Tight since it is meant to be bare bones without decaying into assembly-like.

Q: Why the function syntax is so weird? (v1.0.0)
A: Sorry for that, i'll see if i can make it better for v1.1 onwards

Q: Can I contribute?
A: Yes! I'll make a contributing file soon. But follow the philosophy on spec1.0.0

Q: Function pointers? How I am supposed to make a linked list?
A: I'll add them for 1.1

Q: Where are you from?
A: Mexico
